						<br />

						<br />
						<br />

						Once you have found a genre or book that you find interesting you will be directed to an online bookstore where the genre can be explored and where the book can be purchased.

						<br />
						<br />

						The Books You’ve Been Meaning to Read provides readers with non-personalized book recommendations, and it is a simple and free platform.

						<br />

						The Books You’ve Been Meaning to Read was developed specifically to help readers find a new book to read.
